Threat Modeling with ATT&CK provides a recommended approach that integrates `MITRE
ATT&CK® <https://attack.mitre.org/>`_ – the common language that security operations
teams rely upon – into their organization’s threat modeling practices. The ATT&CK
integration enables cyber defenders to focus on the activity of threat modeling with a
clear, consistent understanding of adversary behaviors and tailor defensive investments
to mitigate threats related to their systems or environments.

This project is created and maintained by `MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed
Defense (Center) <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`_ and is funded by our `research
participants
<https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/threat-modeling-with-attack/#research-participants>`_,
in furtherance of our mission to advance the state of the art and the state of the
practice in threat-informed defense globally.
