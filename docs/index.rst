Threat Modeling with ATT&CK |version|
=====================================

The process outlined in this paper details our recommended approach to integrating ATT&CK into your organization’s existing threat modeling methodology. At the core of this approach are four key questions, outlined in the Threat Modeling Manifesto, that we need to answer:

* Question 1: What are we working on?
* Question 2: What could go wrong?
* Question 3: What are we going to do about it?
* Question 4: Did we do a good job?
