# Threat Modeling with ATT&CK

Threat Modeling with ATT&CK defines how to integrate MITRE ATT&CK® into your
organization’s existing threat modeling methodology. This process is intended for
universal application to any system or technology stack (large or small) using any
existing threat modeling methodology like STRIDE, PASTA, or Attack Trees. To demonstrate
its use and applicability to a wide audience of cybersecurity practitioners, we apply
this process to a fictional internet-of-things (IOT) system called the Ankle Monitoring
Predictor of Stroke (AMPS).
